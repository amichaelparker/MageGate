# MageGate
A (mostly) fixed up version of the MageGate addon for ~~Shadowlands~~ Dragonflight. You need to install `HereBeDragons` separately into your addon folder, either copying it from
this repo or downloaded separately... I may fix this later. Maybe. Assuming I figure out how.

All credits go to the original author (found [here](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/mage-gate)).
